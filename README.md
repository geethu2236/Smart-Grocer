# Smart-Grocer
Smart Grocer is a system that monitors grocery levels using ultrasonic sensors and displays data on a mobile app. It features OTP-based login, Firebase integration, and WhatsApp API for low-level alerts and reordering. Users can view levels, approve orders, and pay via COD or GPay. Future updates include automatic reordering for added convenience.
